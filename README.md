## What does it look like at the moment?

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT THE FINAL DESIGN AND IS SUBJECT FOR A OVERHAUL REDESIGN AND IS JUST SHOWING A CONCEPT**

Here are some images of the fundamental structure of the application at the minute.

### Student Dashboard

On this page, students will be able to get an overview of what is happening.

### Student Timetable

This is where students will be able to view their timetables and edit them if they need to. They will also be able to create their own if they have not been assigned one. Currently, this is still a work in progress.

### Student Kanban (New feature)

This is where students will be able to create their own kanban boards to allow them to organise tasks and work into groups for themselves.

### Student Community

This is where students will be able to collaborate on work and ask each other things related to their own subjects.

### Regarding tutors

In regard to tutor, the views will be similar with additional functionality. There are security measures in place to ensure that there is no access from a student to tutors tools.

### Tutors Group Management

On this page, tutors can create groups of students which could be different classes or such. Groups are groups of students that can be chosen to assign assignments to be tutors, this will be shown further down.

This is where tutors can view who is in the group and edit anything they need to edit regarding the group.

Here is where tutors can select different students to add to the group.

### Tutors Assignment Management

Tutors will have additional options to assign work to students, this is where they will do it. Which can be located inside the assignments tab in the navigation bar.

Finally, tutors can see who has seen the assignment and when they have submitted the students work along with editing the assignment information.
